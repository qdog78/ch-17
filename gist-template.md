## Summary

The regex ^([A-Za-z]+)\s(\d+)$ matches a string that starts with letters, and ends with numbers. In the explanations that follow, we will break down each component of this regex and understand how it works.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors are used to specify the position of the match in the text. In our regex, ^ is the start anchor, and $ is the end anchor. They ensure that the match occurs at the beginning and end of the line, respectively.


### Quantifiers
Quantifiers determine the number of occurrences of a growing element. In our regex, + is a quantifier used after [A-Za-z] and \d, showing that we expect one or more occurrences of letters and digits. A quantifier can also be "-" which can show we want less occurrences.

### Grouping Constructs

Grouping constructs allow us to treat parts of the regex as a single unit. In our regex, ([A-Za-z]+) and (\d+) are two groups enclosed in parentheses. They allow us to extract the matched letters and digits separately. Grouping brings things together.

### Bracket Expressions
Bracket expressions define a character class, specifying a set of characters to match. In our regex, [A-Za-z] matches any uppercase or lowercase letter. 

### Character Classes

Character classes are shortcuts for common sets of characters. In our regex, \d is a character class that matches any digit (0-9). To simplify its an abbreviation. 

### The OR Operator
The OR operator allows for alternative matching.

### Flags
Flags are used to modify the behavior of the regex. Common flags include case-insensitive matching and global matching.


### Character Escapes
Character escapes allow us to match special characters as literals. In our regex, \s is a character escape that matches any null character (e.g., space, tab).
